# TREES-DSA
Trees is a very important Data structure used to tackle and get solutions to various problems. It is a non linear data structure unlike queues,stacks and linked lists.
Trees can be visualized in a hierarchy fashion.
The basic important attributes of a tree are:
1. Node
2. Root
3. Children
4. Parent
5. Siblings
6. Ancestors
7. Descendant
8. Leaf
9. Levels of a tree
10. Sub-trees

<p>The most important type of tree is the Binary tree and a lot of problems can be solved using this type of Tree.
A BINARY TREE basically is a tree in which all the nodes have at max 2 children meaning, every node might have no child, 1 child or 2 children and not more than 2 children.</p>
